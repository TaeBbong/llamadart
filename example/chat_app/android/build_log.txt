Using Kotlin Gradle Plugin gradle813 variant
Your project is configured with Android NDK 28.2.13676358, but the following plugin(s) depend on a different Android NDK version:
- file_picker requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- llamadart requires Android NDK 29.0.14206865
- path_provider_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- shared_preferences_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
Fix this issue by using the highest Android NDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to /opt/UnitySrc/personal/ocs-test/llamadart/example/chat_app/android/app/build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        ndkVersion = "29.0.14206865"
